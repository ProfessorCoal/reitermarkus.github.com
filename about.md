Hi,<br>  
my name is Markus Reiter and I live, work and study in Austria (as in “not the country where kangaroos live” — well, [not currently](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4813976.stm)). I graduated from commercial highschool in June 2014 and I am currently studying Computer Science at the [University of Innsbruck](http://www.uibk.ac.at).

In my spare time I devote myself to creating websites and logos and sometimes designing new fonts. I usually try to keep things simple and minimalist, yet still I have a very good eye for little details that may seem unimportant to others.

I speak nine languages, counting programming languages, that is. Without them I come to a fair amount of 3 ½: German, English, Italian and ½ for my native Tyrolean dialect.
